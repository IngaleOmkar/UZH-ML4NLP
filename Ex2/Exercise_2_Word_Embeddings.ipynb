In NLP, it is almost always the case that your features are\n","words! But how should you represent a word in a computer? You could\n","store its ascii character representation, but that only tells you what\n","the word *is*, it doesn't say much about what it *means* (you might be\n","able to derive its part of speech from its affixes, or properties from\n","its capitalization, but not much). Even more, in what sense could you\n","combine these representations? We often want dense outputs from our\n","neural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where\n","$V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few\n","dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for\n","instance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller\n","dimensional space?\n","\n","How about instead of ascii representations, we use a one-hot encoding?\n","That is, we represent the word $w$ by\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\overbrace{\\left[ 0, 0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0, 0 \\right]}^\\text{|V| elements}\\end{align}\n","\n","where the 1 is in a location unique to $w$. Any other word will\n","have a 1 in some other location, and a 0 everywhere else.\n","\n","\n","There is an enormous drawback to this representation, besides just how\n","huge it is. It basically treats all words as independent entities with\n","no relation to each other. What we really want is some notion of\n","*similarity* between words. Why? Let's see an example.\n","\n","Suppose we are building a language model. Suppose we have seen the\n","sentences\n","\n","* The mathematician ran to the store.\n","\n","* The physicist ran to the store.\n","\n","* The mathematician solved the open problem.\n","\n","in our training data. Now suppose we get a new sentence never before\n","seen in our training data:\n","\n","* The physicist solved the open problem.\n","\n","Our language model might do OK on this sentence, but wouldn't it be much\n","better if we could use the following two facts:\n","\n","* We have seen  mathematician and physicist in the same role in a sentence. Somehow they\n","  have a semantic relation.\n","* We have seen mathematician in the same role  in this new unseen sentence\n","  as we are now seeing physicist.\n","\n","and then infer that physicist is actually a good fit in the new unseen\n","sentence? This is what we mean by a notion of similarity: we mean\n","*semantic similarity*, not simply having similar orthographic\n","representations. It is a technique to combat the sparsity of linguistic\n","data, by connecting the dots between what we have seen and what we\n","haven't. This example of course relies on a fundamental linguistic\n","assumption: that words appearing in similar contexts are related to each\n","other semantically. This is called the `distributional\n","hypothesis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics>`__.\n","\n","# Getting Dense Word Embeddings\n","\n","How can we solve this problem? That is, how could we actually encode\n","semantic similarity in words? Maybe we think up some semantic\n","attributes. For example, we see that both mathematicians and physicists\n","can run, so maybe we give these words a high score for the \"is able to\n","run\" semantic attribute. Think of some other attributes, and imagine\n","what you might score some common words on those attributes.\n","\n","If each attribute is a dimension, then we might give each word a vector,\n","like this:\n","\n","\\begin{align}q_\\text{mathematician} = \\left[ \\overbrace{2.3}^\\text{can run},\n","   \\overbrace{9.4}^\\text{likes coffee}, \\overbrace{-5.5}^\\text{majored in Physics}, \\dots \\right]\\end{align}\n","\n","\\begin{align}q_\\text{physicist} = \\left[ \\overbrace{2.5}^\\text{can run},\n","   \\overbrace{9.1}^\\text{likes coffee}, \\overbrace{6.4}^\\text{majored in Physics}, \\dots \\right]\\end{align}\n","\n","Then we can get a measure of similarity between these words by doing:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\text{Similarity}(\\text{physicist}, \\text{mathematician}) = q_\\text{physicist} \\cdot q_\\text{mathematician}\\end{align}\n","\n","Although it is more common to normalize by the lengths:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\text{Similarity}(\\text{physicist}, \\text{mathematician}) = \\frac{q_\\text{physicist} \\cdot q_\\text{mathematician}}\n","   {\\| q_\\text{\\physicist} \\| \\| q_\\text{mathematician} \\|} = \\cos (\\phi)\\end{align}\n","\n","Where $\\phi$ is the angle between the two vectors. That way,\n","extremely similar words (words whose embeddings point in the same\n","direction) will have similarity 1. Extremely dissimilar words should\n","have similarity -1.\n","\n","You can think of the sparse one-hot vectors from the beginning of this\n","section as a special case of these new vectors we have defined, where\n","each word basically has similarity 0, and we gave each word some unique\n","semantic attribute. These new vectors are *dense*, which is to say their\n","entries are (typically) non-zero.\n","\n","But these new vectors are a big pain: you could think of thousands of\n","different semantic attributes that might be relevant to determining\n","similarity, and how on earth would you set the values of the different\n","attributes? Central to the idea of deep learning is that the neural\n","network learns representations of the features, rather than requiring\n","the programmer to design them herself. So why not just let the word\n","embeddings be parameters in our model, and then be updated during\n","training? This is exactly what we will do. We will have some *latent\n","semantic attributes* that the network can, in principle, learn. Note\n","that the word embeddings will probably not be interpretable. That is,\n","although with our hand-crafted vectors above we can see that\n","mathematicians and physicists are similar in that they both like coffee,\n","if we allow a neural network to learn the embeddings and see that both\n","mathematicians and physicists have a large value in the second\n","dimension, it is not clear what that means. They are similar in some\n","latent semantic dimension, but this probably has no interpretation to\n","us.\n","\n","\n","In summary, **word embeddings are a representation of the *semantics* of\n","a word, efficiently encoding semantic information that might be relevant\n","to the task at hand**. You can embed other things too: part of speech\n","tags, parse trees, anything! The idea of feature embeddings is central\n","to the field.\n","\n","# Word Embeddings in Pytorch\n","\n","Before we get to a worked example and an exercise, a few quick notes\n","about how to use embeddings in Pytorch and in deep learning programming\n","in general. Similar to how we defined a unique index for each word when\n","making one-hot vectors, we also need to define an index for each word\n","when using embeddings. These will be keys into a lookup table. That is,\n","embeddings are stored as a $|V| \\times D$ matrix, where $D$\n","is the dimensionality of the embeddings, such that the word assigned\n","index $i$ has its embedding stored in the $i$'th row of the\n","matrix. In all of my code, the mapping from words to indices is a\n","dictionary named word\\_to\\_ix.\n","\n","The module that allows you to use embeddings is torch.nn.Embedding,\n","which takes two arguments: the vocabulary size, and the dimensionality\n","of the embeddings.\n","\n","To index into this table, you must use torch.LongTensor (since the\n","indices are integers, not floats)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-21T13:36:25.523730Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-21T13:36:25.523425Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-21T13:36:29.951416Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-21T13:36:29.950335Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-21T13:36:25.523698Z"},"id":"M_Q2GVH0OwvH","outputId":"d1992c0c-54c3-4815-dfd1-034ca82961cb","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["<torch._C.Generator at 0x794fd97884d0>"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Author: Robert Guthrie\n","\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\n","\n","torch.manual_seed(1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-21T13:36:29.954318Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-21T13:36:29.953766Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-21T13:36:30.081750Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-21T13:36:30.080600Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-21T13:36:29.954271Z"},"id":"MN96_fK5Plv6","outputId":"06242940-0964-469a-8f61-39aba10332d3","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([[ 0.6614,  0.2669,  0.0617,  0.6213, -0.4519]],\n","       grad_fn=<EmbeddingBackward0>)\n"]}],"source":["word_to_ix = {\"hello\": 0, \"world\": 1}\n","embeds = nn.Embedding(2, 5)  # 2 words in vocab, 5 dimensional embeddings\n","lookup_tensor = torch.tensor([word_to_ix[\"hello\"]], dtype=torch.long)\n","hello_embed = embeds(lookup_tensor)\n","print(hello_embed)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l3ecRemdPstX"},"source":["# An Example: N-Gram Language Modeling\n","\n","Recall that in an n-gram language model, given a sequence of words\n","$w$, we want to compute\n","\n","\\begin{align}P(w_i | w_{i-1}, w_{i-2}, \\dots, w_{i-n+1} )\\end{align}\n","\n","Where $w_i$ is the ith word of the sequence.\n","\n","In this example, we will compute the loss function on some training\n","examples and update the parameters with backpropagation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-21T13:36:30.084157Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-21T13:36:30.083371Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-21T13:36:32.165868Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-21T13:36:32.164895Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-21T13:36:30.084106Z"},"id":"FbPuck6EPn2x","outputId":"9b037d14-ef15-4153-f94a-61af2072e623","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[(['When', 'forty'], 'winters'), (['forty', 'winters'], 'shall'), (['winters', 'shall'], 'besiege')]\n","Loss in Epoch 0: 520.92\n","Loss in Epoch 1: 518.34\n","Loss in Epoch 2: 515.78\n","Loss in Epoch 3: 513.23\n","Loss in Epoch 4: 510.71\n","Loss in Epoch 5: 508.2\n","Loss in Epoch 6: 505.7\n","Loss in Epoch 7: 503.22\n","Loss in Epoch 8: 500.74\n","Loss in Epoch 9: 498.28\n"]}],"source":["CONTEXT_SIZE = 2\n","\n","EMBEDDING_DIM = 10\n","\n","# We will use Shakespeare Sonnet 2\n","\n","test_sentence = \"\"\"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\n","And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\n","Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,\n","Will be a totter'd weed of small worth held:\n","Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\n","Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;\n","To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\n","Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\n","How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,\n","If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine\n","Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'\n","Proving his beauty by succession thine!\n","This were to be new made when thou art old,\n","And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.\"\"\".split()\n","\n","# we should tokenize the input, but we will ignore that for now\n","# build a list of tuples.

Introduction\n","\n","Word embeddings have become a fundamental component in natural language processing tasks, providing dense vector representations that capture semantic relationships between words. This assignment focuses on the CBOW model, examining its performance across different domains and context sizes.\n","\n","## 2. Methodology\n","\n","### 2.1 Datasets\n","Two datasets were used in this study:\n","1. Hotel Reviews: A collection of hotel reviews.\n","2. Science Fiction: A corpus of science fiction text.\n","\n","### 2.2 Preprocessing\n","The preprocessing can be broken down into two sub-parts:\n","\n","#### 2.2.1 Data Preprocessing\n","- ```Text Lowercasing```: All text was converted to lowercase to ensure consistency.\n","- ```Punctuation Removal```: All punctuation marks were removed from the text using Python's string.punctuation.\n","- ```Special Character and Number Removal```: A regular expression was used to remove any remaining special characters and numbers, leaving only alphabetic characters and spaces.\n","- ```Tokenization```: The NLTK word_tokenize function was used to split the text into individual words or tokens.\n","- ```Rejoining```: The tokenized words were rejoined into a single string, effectively creating a cleaned version of the original text with only lowercase alphabetic words separated by spaces.\n","\n","#### 2.2.2 Creating Dataset, Dataloaders for training and testing\n","- Vocabulary Creation: \n","  - We extracted all unique words from the cleaned text using the ```get_unique_words``` function.\n","  - A word-to-index dictionary was created to map each unique word to a unique integer index.\n","- CBOW Pair Generation:\n","  - We implemented a generate_cbow function that creates context-target pairs for each word in a given text.\n","  - This function was applied to each cleaned review/text, creating a new column 'cbows2' (for context size 2) or 'cbows5' (for context size 5) containing these pairs.\n","- Custom Dataset Class:\n","  - We created a custom  ```CBOWDataset``` class that inherits from torch.utils.data.Dataset.\n","  - This class takes the DataFrame with CBOW pairs, the vocabulary-to-index mapping, and the column name containing the CBOW pairs.\n","  - It processes each CBOW pair, converting words to their corresponding indices.\n","  - The ```__getitem__``` method returns a tuple of (context_indices, target_index) for each item.\n","- Dataset Creation:\n","  - Instances of the ```CBOWDataset``` class were created for each dataset and context size (e.g., reviews_cb2_dataset, reviews_cb5_dataset, scifi_cb2_dataset).\n","- DataLoader Creation:\n","  - PyTorch DataLoaders were created from these datasets (e.g., ```review_cb2_dataloader```, ```review_cb5_dataloader```, ```scifi_cb2_dataloader```).\n","  - These DataLoaders were configured with a batch size of 128 and shuffling enabled.\n","\n","### 2.3 Model Architecture\n","We implemented a CBOW model using PyTorch, with the following architecture:\n","- ```Embedding Layer```: This layer maps each word to a dense vector of dimension 50.\n","- ```Hidden Layer```: This layer performs a linear transformation on the concatenated context vectors.\n","- ```Output Layer```: This layer applies a softmax activation function to the transformed vectors, producing a probability distribution over all words in the vocabulary.\n","\n","### 2.4 Training Procedure\n","Models were trained with the following parameters:\n","\n","| Parameter           | Hotel Reviews (CBOW2) | Hotel Reviews (CBOW5) | Sci-Fi (CBOW2) |\n","|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n","| Embedding Dimension | 50                     | 50                     | 50              |\n","| Context Window Size | 2                      | 5                      | 2               |\n","| Optimizer           | Adam                   | Adam                   | Adam            |\n","| Learning Rate       | 0.01                   | 0.01                   | 0.01            |\n","| Number of Epochs    | 15                     | 15                     | 3               |\n","| Batch Size          | 128                    | 128                    | 128             |\n","| Loss Function       | CrossEntropyLoss       | CrossEntropyLoss       | CrossEntropyLoss|\n","\n","## 3.

CBOW2, with its smaller context window, tends to capture more specific and localized semantic relationships. For instance, it associates \"staff\" with specific service-related terms like \"towelpool\" and \"receptionist\". In contrast, CBOW5, with its larger context window, seems to capture broader, more general semantic relationships. It associates \"staff\" with more general positive descriptors like \"amazing\" and action words like \"work\" and \"going\". This pattern is consistent across different word types. For nouns, CBOW5 tends to find more general descriptors, while CBOW2 finds more specific, contextually related words. For verbs and adjectives, CBOW5 often associates words with very high similarity scores (often 0.99) to general, frequently used words, while CBOW2 finds more nuanced, specific associations. These differences suggest that increasing the context size allows the model to capture broader semantic relationships, potentially at the cost of losing some specific, localized meanings. The choice between a smaller or larger context size thus depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand - whether more specific, localized semantic relationships are needed, or broader, more general associations are preferred.\n","\n","### 3.2 Science Fiction Dataset\n","The CBOW2 model trained on the science fiction dataset shows different semantic relationships:\n","- Nouns:\n","  - \"robot\": associated with action-related terms (e.g., \"relents\", \"wonderful\")\n","  - \"spaceship\": linked to communication and space-related terms (e.g., \"talks\", \"intercom\")\n","  - \"planet\": associated with proper nouns, possibly character or place names (e.g., \"engraham\")\n","These associations reflect the typical themes and vocabulary of science fiction, demonstrating the model's ability to capture domain-specific semantic relationships.\n","\n","### 3.3 Cross-Domain Comparison\n","Comparing embeddings between hotel reviews and science fiction domains reveals interesting differences:\n","- \"room\":\n","  - In hotel reviews: associated with hotel features and customer service\n","  - In science fiction: linked to more abstract concepts (e.g., \"reports\", \"kid\", \"joke\")\n","- \"travel\":\n","  - In hotel reviews: associated with practical aspects of travel (e.g., \"warmthe\", \"merchant\", \"summer\")\n","  - In science fiction: linked to more conceptual terms (e.g., \"gladly\", \"difficulties\", \"luxuries\")\n","These differences highlight how the same word can have different semantic associations depending on the domain, demonstrating the models' ability to capture context-specific meanings.\n","The quality of embeddings appears to be influenced by the size and nature of the corpus. The hotel reviews dataset, being larger and more focused, seems to produce more consistent and domain-relevant embeddings. The science fiction dataset, potentially smaller and more diverse in vocabulary, shows more varied and sometimes unexpected associations.\n","\n","## 4. Conclusion\n","\n","This study has provided valuable insights into the application of Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) models for generating word embeddings across different domains and context sizes. Our analysis of CBOW models trained on hotel reviews and science fiction text has revealed several key findings:\n","1. Context Window Size Impact: The size of the context window significantly influences the nature of semantic relationships captured by the model. Smaller context windows (CBOW2) tend to capture more specific, localized semantic relationships, while larger windows (CBOW5) capture broader, more general associations.\n","2. Domain-Specific Embeddings: The CBOW models successfully captured domain-specific semantic relationships in both the hotel reviews and science fiction datasets. This demonstrates the model's ability to adapt to different vocabularies and contextual uses of words across domains.\n","3. Cross-Domain Differences: The comparison of common words across domains highlighted how the same words can have vastly different semantic associations depending on the context of the corpus. This underscores the importance of domain-specific training for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of text.\n","4. Training Dynamics: The CBOW5 model, with its larger context window, showed slower convergence compared to CBOW2, suggesting a trade-off between the breadth of semantic capture and training efficiency.\n","\n","In conclusion, this study demonstrates the flexibility and power of CBOW models in capturing semantic relationships, while also highlighting the importance of careful consideration of model parameters and training data characteristics in generating effective word embeddings.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["--------"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Answers to questions asked \n","\n","## 1. Describe your decisions for preprocessing the datasets\n","\n","- ```Text lowercasing:``` All text was converted to lowercase to ensure consistency and reduce vocabulary size by treating words like \"Hotel\" and \"hotel\" as the same token.\n","- ```Punctuation removal:``` All punctuation marks were removed using Python's string.punctuation. This helps standardize the text and removes noise that may not contribute significantly to the semantic meaning.\n","- ```Special character and number removal:``` A regular expression was used to remove any remaining special characters and numbers. This further cleans the text, focusing solely on alphabetic words which are most relevant for semantic analysis.\n","- ```Tokenization:``` The NLTK word_tokenize function was used to split the text into individual words or tokens. This is a standard NLP preprocessing step that prepares the text for further analysis.\n","- ```Rejoining:``` The tokenized words were rejoined into a single string. This step creates a cleaned version of the original text with only lowercase alphabetic words separated by spaces.\n","\n","These preprocessing steps were chosen to:\n","- Standardize the text format across all reviews/documents\n","- Reduce noise and irrelevant information\n","- Focus on the core semantic content of the text\n","- Prepare the text for efficient tokenization and embedding\n","\n","The same preprocessing was applied to both the hotel reviews and sci-fi datasets to ensure consistency. However, it's worth noting that this approach may remove some potentially useful information (e.g., numbers in hotel ratings, capitalization for proper nouns in sci-fi). For more specialized applications, one might consider preserving some of this information or using more sophisticated preprocessing techniques.\n","\n","## 2. Are predictions made by the model sensitive towards the context size?\n","\n","Yes, the predictions made by the model are sensitive towards the context size. The model is more likely to make accurate predictions when the context size is appropriate for the task at hand. For example, if the task requires capturing local, specific semantic relationships, a smaller context size (e.g., CBOW2) would be more appropriate. Conversely, if the task requires capturing broader, more general semantic relationships, a larger context size (e.g., CBOW5) would be more appropriate.\n","\n","## 3.

Here's a breakdown of the observations:\n","\n","#### CBOW2 Model \n","- Specificity: The CBOW2 model, with a smaller context window, tends to capture more specific and localized semantic relationships. For example, the word \"staff\" is associated with terms like \"towelpool\" and \"receptionist,\" which are specific to the context of hotel services.\n","- Contextual Relevance: The closest words often reflect the immediate context in which the target word appears. For instance, \"recommend\" is associated with \"definately\" and \"hesitate,\" which are relevant in the context of making recommendations.\n","- Domain-Specific Associations: The model captures domain-specific terms effectively, such as \"spacious\" and \"tidy\" for \"clean,\" which are relevant adjectives in hotel reviews.\n","\n","#### CBOW5 Model\n","- Generalization: The CBOW5 model, with a larger context window, captures broader and more general semantic relationships. For example, \"staff\" is associated with more general descriptors like \"amazing\" and \"work.\"\n","- High Similarity Scores: The model often outputs very high similarity scores (close to 0.99) for the closest words, indicating strong associations. However, these associations are sometimes with very common words like \"very\" and \"really,\" which might not always be contextually specific.\n","- Broader Context Capture: The larger context window allows the model to capture more general associations, such as \"perfect\" and \"excellent\" for \"location,\" which are broad descriptors.\n","\n","#### Overall Assessment\n","- CBOW2: The words output by the CBOW2 model generally make sense within the specific context of hotel reviews. The model effectively captures localized semantic relationships, making it suitable for tasks requiring detailed contextual understanding.\n","- CBOW5: The CBOW5 model outputs words that make sense in a broader context. It captures general semantic relationships, which can be useful for tasks that benefit from a wider contextual understanding. However, the high similarity scores with common words suggest that it might sometimes overlook more nuanced, specific associations.\n","In summary, both models perform well in capturing semantic relationships, but their effectiveness depends on the task requirements. CBOW2 is better for specific, context-rich tasks, while CBOW5 is more suited for general, context-wide tasks.\n","\n","## 4.

The CBOW2 model captures more specific and localized semantic relationships. \n","\n","## 5. How does the quality of the hotel review-based embeddings compare with the Sci-fi-based embeddings? Elaborate.\n","\n","The hotel review-based embeddings generally exhibit higher quality and consistency compared to the Sci-fi-based embeddings. This is likely due to the more focused and standardized nature of hotel reviews, which results in a coherent vocabulary and clear semantic relationships. For instance, words like \"staff\" and \"clean\" show strong, relevant associations in the hotel domain. In contrast, the Sci-fi embeddings, while more diverse and imaginative, display less consistent relationships, reflecting the genre's varied narratives and speculative nature. This difference highlights how domain specificity can significantly impact the quality and practical utility of word embeddings.\n","\n","## 6. Do they have different neighbours? If yes, can you reason why?\n","\n","Yes, the hotel review-based embeddings and Sci-fi-based embeddings have different neighbors for common words. This can be observed in the outputs for common words like \"room\" and \"travel\" when given to both models:\n","\n","For the hotel review dataset:\n","| Word | CBOW5 Top 5 | CBOW2 Top 5 |\n","|------|-------------|-------------|\n","| room | (coffee, 0.93), (open, 0.92), (sucker, 0.92), (unattractive, 0.92), (prosperous, 0.91) | (harbourcity, 0.58), (customer, 0.57), (immature, 0.57), (touchroom, 0.56), (rijstaffel, 0.56) |\n","| travel | (boyfriend, 0.92), (service, 0.88), (san, 0.88), (location, 0.85), (worn, 0.88) | (warmthe, 0.56), (merchant, 0.56), (summer, 0.55), (amenities, 0.55), (families, 0.55) |\n","\n","For the Sci-fi dataset:\n","| Word | CBOW2 Top 5 |\n","|------|-------------|\n","| room | (reports, 0.9999), (kid, 0.9997), (joke, 0.9996), (cocked, 0.9994), (martian, 0.9929) |\n","| travel | (gladly, 0.9221), (difficulties, 0.7806), (luxuries, 0.7597), (yheel, 0.7596), (mathews, 0.7238) |\n","\n","### The differences in neighbors can be attributed to several factors:\n","\n","- Domain-specific context: In hotel reviews, \"room\" is associated with physical attributes and amenities, while in Sci-fi, it might relate to spacecraft interiors or alien environments.\n","- Genre-specific associations: Sci-fi literature often uses common words in unconventional contexts, leading to unique word associations not found in more practical domains like hotel reviews.\n","\n","These differences highlight how the same words can have vastly different semantic relationships depending on the domain and context of the training data.\n","\n","## 7. What are the differences between CBOW2 and CBOW5 ? Can you \"describe\" them?\n","\n","The main differences between CBOW2 and CBOW5 are:\n","\n","1. Context window size:\n","    - CBOW2 uses a context window of 2 words on each side of the target word.\n","    - CBOW5 uses a larger context window of 5 words on each side of the target word.\n","\n","2. Semantic capture:\n","    - CBOW2 captures more localized, specific semantic relationships.\n","    - CBOW5 captures broader, more general semantic relationships.\n","\n","3.

Word associations:\n","    - CBOW2 tends to find closer, more directly related words.\n","    - CBOW5 often finds more diverse, sometimes less obvious associations.\n","\n","In summary, CBOW2 provides a more focused, context-specific understanding, while CBOW5 offers a broader, more general semantic representation of words.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyONe+w97y8emZNdcEn1hSBH","include_colab_link":true,"provenance":[]},"kaggle":{"accelerator":"nvidiaTeslaT4","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30787,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
